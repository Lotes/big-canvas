# ABOUT

big-canvas is a collaborative drawing tool for the browser. It is a practically infinite drawing surface. You can draw with a brush, use an eraser, undo an action or redo it.

(The following description explains the idea behind big-canvas. But it is not implemented so far. Please be patient ;D. See the `FEATURES.md` and `TODO.md` for the current progress.)

TODO add more description
