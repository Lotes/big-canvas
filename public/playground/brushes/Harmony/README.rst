This version of mrdoob's and rhyolight's Harmony application aims to provide
some extra functionality including:

- better palette (bounds + slots interpolated between those)
- undo/redo
- gradient background (x/y/others?)
- scanfill brush

Currently it provides following extra functionality:

- mirroring (x, y, radial)
- "sticky" palette (shift). Note that it's not possible to paint under the
  palette!
- vertical constraint (hit s while painting)
- horizontal constraint (hit a while painting)
- perspective constraint (hit d while painting, set target with f)
